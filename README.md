# English grammar

I am composing this document to improve my understanding of the English
language.
Should others find this resource useful, I would be honored.

## Nouns

- **common nouns** – general names for persons, places or things (e.g. *man*,
*city*, *function*, *database*)
- **proper nouns** – specific names of people, places or things, pointing
to unique entities (e.g. *Joseph*, *New York*, *Eiffel Tower*, *Linux*)
- **countable nouns** – nouns that allow for quantification (e.g.
*one variable*, *two variables*)
- **uncountable nouns** – nouns that do not (typically) have a plural form
(e.g. *software*, *information*, *water*); a unit of measurement can be added
to quantify these nouns (e.g. *a piece of information*, *a bottle of water*)
- **abstract nouns** – nouns representing ideas, qualities or conditions
that cannot be perceived by the human senses (e.g. *freedom*, *justice*,
*complexity*, *efficiency*)
- **concrete nouns** – opposite of abstract nouns; pointing to things that
you can either see, hear, touch, smell or taste (e.g. *monitor*)
- **collective nouns** – nouns referring to a group of individuals or things
(e.g. *family*, *team*, *array*)
- **compound nouns** – nouns made up of two or more words that together
express a single concept (e.g. *source code*, *command line*)
- **possessive nouns** – nouns indicating ownership or possession (e.g.
*application's performance*, *system's architecture*)
