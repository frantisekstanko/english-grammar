# English grammar

I am composing this document to improve my understanding of the English
language.
Should others find this resource useful, I would be honored.

## Nouns

Nouns are words used to identify people, places, things, or ideas.
They serve as the subjects or objects within sentences,
encapsulating everything from concrete entities to abstract concepts.

- **common nouns** – general names for people, places or things (e.g.
*developer, algorithm, module, interface*)
- **proper nouns** – specific names of people, places or things, pointing
to unique entities (e.g. *Linus Torvalds, Silicon Valley, GitHub, Python*)
- **countable nouns** – nouns that allow for quantification (e.g.
*one thread, two repositories, three servers*)
- **uncountable nouns** – nouns that do not (typically) have a plural form
(e.g. *documentation, data, bandwidth*); a unit of measurement can be added
to quantify these nouns (e.g. *a block of code, a bit of data, a segment
of bandwidth*)
- **abstract nouns** – nouns representing ideas, qualities or conditions
that cannot be perceived by the human senses (e.g. *freedom*, *justice*,
*complexity*, *efficiency*)
- **concrete nouns** – opposite of abstract nouns; pointing to things that
you can either see, hear, touch, smell or taste (e.g. *keyboard, processor,
motherboard*)
- **collective nouns** – nouns referring to a group of individuals or things
(e.g. *family*, *team*, *array*, *dataset*)
- **compound nouns** – nouns made up of two or more words that together
express a single concept (e.g. *source code*, *command line*, *binary tree*)
- **possessive nouns** – nouns indicating ownership or possession (e.g.
*application's performance*, *system's architecture*, *program's output*)

## Pronouns

Pronouns are words used to replace nouns, thereby avoiding repetition.

- [**personal pronouns**](pronouns/personal-pronouns.md) – pronouns representing specific people or things (e.g. *he*,
*she*, *it*)
- [**possessive pronouns**](pronouns/possessive-pronouns.md) – pronouns indicating possession (e.g. *his*, *hers*)
- [**reflexive pronouns**](pronouns/reflexive-pronouns.md) – pronouns used when the subject and the object of the sentence
are the same entity, indicating that an action is performed on oneself
(e.g. *myself*, *himself*, *herself*)
- [**indefinite pronouns**](pronouns/indefinite-pronouns.md) – pronouns referring to nonspecific persons or things, used
when the exact identity is unknown or irrelevant (e.g. *someone*)

## Verbs

Verbs are words that express actions, occurrences, or states of being.
They provide crucial information about what the subject is doing
or the situation the subject is in.

- **action verbs** – verbs expressing visible (physical) or conceptual (mental)
actions (e.g. *write*, *walk*, *estimate*)
- **linking verbs** – verbs connecting the subject of the sentence to a subject
complement (noun or adjective), which describes the subject (e.g. the
software *seems* faulty)
- **auxiliary verbs** – verbs used in connection with a main verb to create
phrases that convey tense, mood or voice (e.g. *be*, *have*, *do*)
- **modal verbs** – verbs conveying attitudes about the action indicated
by the main verb; a necessity, possibility, permission or ability (e.g. *can*,
*must*, *should*)
- **transitive verbs** – action verbs that require a direct object to complete
their meaning; the action of the verb is transferred to the object (e.g.
*update*, *remove*)
- **intransitive verbs** – action verbs that do not require a direct object
to complete their meaning; the action remains with the subject (e.g. *agree*,
*skip*)
- [**phrasal verbs**](verbs/phrasal-verbs.md) – expressions that combine a verb
with a preposition or adverb (or both) and function as a single semantic unit;
the meaning of a phrasal verb can be different from the meanings of its separate
parts (e.g. *look up, bring about, break down*)
- **stative verbs** – describe a state or condition, often relating to thoughts,
emotions, senses or states of being (e.g. *believe*, *love*, *know*)
- **dynamic verbs** – opposite of stative verbs, dynamic verbs describe actions
that have duration (e.g. *run*, *speak*)
- **impersonal verbs** – verbs not referring to a specific subject but rather
expressing actions or states related to time, distances, weather or natural
forces (e.g. *it rains, it seems*)
- **regular verbs** – form their past forms by adding *-ed*
- **irregular verbs** – have separate past forms (e.g. *go → went*)

## Subject

Subject is the person or thing that performs the action described by the verb,
or the person or thing that the sentence is about.

## Object

Object is the person or thing that receives the action of the verb.
It is the entity that is affected by the action.

## Adjectives

Adjectives are words that modify or describe attributes of nouns, providing
additional information about their quantity, quality, size, condition,
or origin.

- **descriptive adjectives** – describe the qualities or states
of nouns (e.g. *efficient*, *user-friendly*)
- **comparative adjectives** – compare two entities (e.g. *faster*,
*more efficient*)
- **superlative adjectives** – indicate the highest level of a particular
quality within a group of entities (e.g. *fastest algorithm*,
*least secure protocol*)
- **quantitative adjectives** – indicate the amount of nouns (e.g. *zero*,
*one*, *multiple*, *much*)
- **demonstrative adjectives** – specify which nouns we're talking about,
differentiating between things that are near or further away (e.g. *this*,
*those*, *that*)
- **possessive adjectives** – denote ownership (*my, your, his, her, its, our,
their*)
- **interrogative adjectives** – modify nouns in questions (*which*, *what*,
*whose*)
- **distributive adjectives** – refer to members of a group separately (e.g.
*each*, *every*, *either*)
- **indefinite adjectives** – give general, non-specific information about
the noun (e.g. *some*, *any*, *few*)
- **ordinal adjectives** – express the position of a noun in a sequence
(e.g. *first*, *second*, *third*)
- **proper adjectives** – derived from proper nouns, these adjectives describe
a particular thing associated with a specific person or a place and are
therefore always capitalized (e.g. *Agile methodology*, *Linux-based system*)

## Prepositions

Prepositions are words that link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other parts
of a sentence, typically indicating relationships in terms of place, time,
or direction.

- **prepositions of direction** – indicate movement from one place to another
(*to, through, into, toward, onto, from, off, out of, past, up, down, over,
under, around, across, along, through, towards, after, before, behind, beside,
between, beyond, by*)
- **prepositions of location** – indicate the place where something is located
(*at, on, in, by, next to, beside, near, among, between, against, underneath,
beneath, below, above, over, inside, outside, on top of, in front of, behind*)
- **prepositions of time** – denote the time something happens (*at, on, in, by,
before, after, during, until, since, from, to, past, within, throughout, over,
under*)
- **prepositions of agent** – reveal the *doer* of an action in passive
sentences (*by*, *about*, *for*, *with*)
- **prepositions of manner** – indicate *how* a certain action was performed
(*by, with, in, on, like, as, in the manner of, via, through*)
- **prepositions of instrument** – indicate the *tool* used to perform an action
(*with, by, on, using, through, via*)
- **prepositions of purpose** – indicate the purpose of an action (*for, to,
in order to, so as to, for the purpose of*)
- **prepositions of possession** – indicate ownership (*of*, *with*, *to*)

## Tenses

Tenses are used to express time in relation to the moment of speaking.

- **past simple** – describes actions that were completed at a specific time
in the past (e.g. *Yesterday, I debugged the application.*)
- **past continuous** – indicates ongoing actions that were happening at a
particular moment in the past. (e.g. *I was compiling when the system crashed.*)
- **past perfect** – describes an action that had been completed before another
action occurred in the past (e.g. *By the time the meeting started, I had
already pushed my commits.*)
- **past perfect continuous** – indicates actions that had been ongoing over
a period in the past and were completed by a certain point in the past (e.g.
*I had been testing the application for hours before I identified the bug.*)
- **present simple** – expresses general truths, habits or routines (e.g.
*I write code every day.*)
- **present continuous** – indicates ongoing actions occurring at the moment
of speaking (e.g. *I am performing a code review.*)
- **present perfect** – describes actions that occurred at an unspecified
time in the past and have relevance to the present moment (e.g. *I have fixed
the bug.*)
- **present perfect continuous** – indicates actions that began in the past
and continue to the present (e.g. *I have been working on this branch since
last week.*)
- **future simple** – expresses actions that will happen in the future (e.g.
*I will push my commits tomorrow.*)
- **future continuous** – indicates actions that will be ongoing at a specific
time in the future (e.g. *At this time tomorrow, I will be helping my
colleague.*)
- **future perfect** – describes actions that will be completed *before*
a certain point in the future (e.g. *By the end of the month, I will have
completed my task.*)
- **future perfect continuous** – indicates actions that will be ongoing until
a specific point in the future (e.g. *By next year, I will have been working
in this company for five years.*)

## Conditionals

Conditionals refer to if–then constructions that express hypotheses and their
potential consequences.

- **zero conditional** – used for facts or general truths, where the outcome
is always true if the condition is met; the structure is:  
[if] + [present simple], [present simple] (e.g. *If water reaches 100 degrees
Celsius, it boils.*)

- **first conditional** – expresses a *possible* condition and its *probable*
result in the future; the structure is:  
[if] + [present simple], [will] + [base form of the verb] (e.g. *If the user
enters incorrect login details, the system will display an error message.*)

- **second conditional** – expresses situations that are hypothetical, imaginary
or otherwise unlikely; the structure is:  
[if] + [past simple], [would] + [base form of the verb] (e.g. *If I were a
better software engineer, I would design a more efficient system.*)

- **third conditional** – reflects on the past, imagining a different outcome
from what actually happened, contradicting the past facts; the structure is:  
[if] + [past perfect], [would have] + [past participle] (e.g. *If the programmer
had written stronger tests, they would have caught the bug earlier.*)

- **mixed conditional** – combines the second and third conditionals, reflecting
a present result of an unreal past condition; the structure is:
[if] + [past perfect], [would] + [base form of verb] (e.g. *If the development
team had followed the project timeline, we would be ahead of schedule now.*)

Note: Mixed conditionals can be complex and exhibit considerable variation in
structure. They often mix time references, combining unreal past conditions
with present or future outcomes.

### Inversion of conditionals

In the inversion of conditionals, the word *if* is eliminated and the subject
and auxiliary verb are inverted, akin to forming a question (e.g. *Had the
programmer written stronger tests, they would have caught the bug earlier.*)

## Articles

Articles are words that define a noun as specific or unspecific.

- **definite article** – *the* – used to refer to specific or particular nouns,
employed when both the speaker and the listener know the specific entity being
referred to, either because there is only one, or because it has been previously
mentioned or is common knowledge. (e.g. *The compiler generated an error.*)
- **indefinite article** – *a* or *an* – used to refer to non-specific nouns
that are being mentioned for the first time, or whose exact identity is not
important, or unknown (e.g. *We need a software developer for this task.*)
- **zero article** – used with plural or uncountable nouns when referring
to them in a general sense (e.g. *Software engineers are in high demand
nowadays.*)

## Adverbs

Adverbs are primarily used to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
They provide additional information about how, when, where, and to what extent
an action is performed.

- **adverbs of manner** – describe the way in which something is done (e.g.
*quickly*); are placed directly after the verb they modify (.e.g *The system
operates efficiently.*)
- **adverbs of frequency** – express how often an action occurs (e.g.
*frequently*); are placed before the main verb, but after auxiliary verbs
(e.g. *The function always returns a value.*)
- **adverbs of time** – describe the timing of an action (e.g. *nightly*,
*weekly*); are placed at the end of the sentence
- **adverbs of place** – describe the location of an action (e.g. *remotely*);
are placed at the end of the sentence
- **adverbs of degree** – describe the degree of an action, adjective, or
another adverb (e.g. *nearly*); usually precede the word they are modifying
- **adverbs of probability** – indicate the likelihood of an action happening
(e.g. *possibly*); are placed before the main verb, but after auxiliary verbs
- **adverbs of affirmation and negation** – confirm or deny the action of the
verb (e.g. *certainly*); are generally placed before the main verb, but after
the verb "to be" or modal verbs

In sentences with multiple verbs, adverbs can be placed after the first
auxiliary verb or at the end of the sentence, depending on emphasis.
(e.g. *The program can easily modify the file.*)

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses.

- **coordinating conjunctions** – link similar elements (e.g. *The code compiles, but
does not execute.*)
- **subordinating conjunctions** – connect an independent clause with a dependent clause
(e.g. *Although the code application runs quickly, it consumes much memory.*)
- **correlative conjunctions** – link equal elements (e.g. *Either the test suite
passes, or the issue goes back to progress.*)
- **conjunctive adverbs** – link independent clauses to show cause and effect
(e.g. *therefore*, *likewise*, *otherwise*, *furthermore*)

## Clauses

Clauses typically contain a subject and a predicate, the former being the
actor in the sentence and the latter describing the action or state of being. 

- **main (independent) clauses** – are capable of standing alone as complete
sentences because they express a complete thought (e.g. *The program compiles
successfully.*)
- **subordinate (dependent) clauses** – depend on each other, as both provide
information needed to form a complete sentence (e.g. *Although we are doing
our best, we are behind schedule.*)
- [**relative (adjective) clauses**](clauses/relative-clauses.md) – provide
additional information about a noun or pronoun in the sentence (e.g. *This
feature, which was developed by John, has received good feedback.*)
- **noun clauses** – act as the subject, object, or complement in a sentence,
performing the function of a noun (e.g. *What she said at the meeting was
surprising.*)

## Types of sentences

- **simple sentence** – one independent clause without any subordinate
clauses; has a subject, a predicate, and expresses a complete thought (e.g.
*The function works correctly.*)
- **compound sentence** – two independent clauses with related ideas of equal
importance (e.g. *The developer writes the code, and the machine executes it.*)
- **complex sentence** – one independent clause and at least one dependent
clause (e.g. *If the user inputs invalid data, the program displays an error
message.*)
- **compound-complex sentence** – at least two independent clauses and at least
one dependent clause (e.g. *The software passes all tests, but when it
encounters unexpected inputs, it fails to function properly.*)

## Interjections

Words or phrases that express strong emotion or surprise.

- **primary interjections** – words that function solely as interjections
with no other grammatical purpose (e.g. *Wow!, Oops!*
- **secondary interjections** – words borrowed from other parts of speech that
serve temporarily as interjections (e.g. *Great!, Well..., No way!*)
- **vocative interjections** – words used to call or summon someone
(e.g. *Hey, John... Excuse me, sir...*)
- **exclamatory interjections** – words that express strong emotion
(e.g. *Fantastic!*)
- **greeting interjections** – words used in social interactions to greet
or acknowledge others (e.g. *Hello! Good morning!*)
- **farewell interjections** – words used when parting from someone or ending
a conversation (e.g. *Goodbye!*)

## Purposes of sentences

- **declarative** – sentences that make a statement or express a fact (e.g.
*This function returns a JSON object.*)
- **interrogative** – questions requesting information or clarification (e.g.
*Does the API support GET requests?*)
- **imperative** – commands or requests (e.g. *Execute the script.*)
- **exclamatory** – expressions of strong emotion or excitement (e.g.
*Incredible performance boost!*)

## Voice

- **active** – in active voice, the subject performs the action expressed by
the verb (e.g. *The programmer writes the code.*)
- **passive** – passive voice emphasizes the action being done to the subject
or the subject receiving the action; the doer, if mentioned, comes after the
action, introduced by the preposition *by* (e.g. *The code is being written
by Joseph.*)

## Moods

- **indicative mood** — used to state facts, ask questions, or express opinions
as if they were facts (e.g. *She writes every day.*)
- **imperative mood** – used for commands, instructions, requests,
or suggestions (e.g. *Please close the door.*)
- **subjunctive mood** – used for wishes, hypothetical situations, demands,
or conditions contrary to fact (e.g. *If I were a better software engineer,
the tests would be more stable.*)
- **conditional mood** – utilizes auxiliary verbs to create conditions and
hypothetical scenarios (e.g. *I would travel if I had more time.*)
- **interrogative mood** – used for questions (e.g. *Do you know the time?*)
- **infinitive mood** – basic form of the verb without inflection to indicate
tense, mood, or aspect (e.g. *To optimize the algorithm, one must analyze its
complexity and resource consumption.*)

## Idiomatic expressions

Idiomatic expressions are phrases whose meanings cannot be understood from
the literal interpretation of the words (e.g. *go down the rabbit hole,
reinvent the wheel, back to the drawing board*)

## Quantifiers

- **quantifiers for countable nouns** (e.g. *many, few, a few, several,
a couple of, numerous*)
- **quantifiers for uncountable nouns** (e.g. *much, little, a bit of,
a great deal of, a large amount of*)
- **universal quantifiers** – can be used with both countable and uncountable
nouns and denote complete inclusion or exclusion (e.g. *all, every, no, none*)

## Order of adjectives

1) **quantity**
2) **opinion**
3) **size**
4) **physical quality**
5) **shape**
6) **age**
7) **color**
8) **origin**
9) **material**
10) **type**
11) **purpose**

## Figures of speech

- **metaphor** – figure of speech that makes na implicit, implied or hidden
comparison between two unrelated things (e.g. *This new database is the backbone
of our application.*)
- **simile** – figure of speech that compares two different things using
the words *like* or *as* (e.g. *Debugging this code is like looking for a needle
in a haystack.*)
- **alliteration** – repetition of the same initial consonant sound in a series
of words (e.g. *Software solutions significantly streamline system setup.*)
- **hyperbole** – exaggerated statement or claim not meant to be taken literally
(e.g. *It would take an eternity to process data this large without optimizing
our algorithms.*)
- **personification** – attribution of a personal nature or human
characteristics to something non-human, or the representation of an abstract
quality in human form (e.g. *The server is exhausted from handling thousands
of requests per second.*)
- **irony** – stating something in a way that is the opposite of what is
expected (e.g. *After coding for 12 hours straight to fix the bug, the solution
was to restart the system.*)
- **oxymoron** – figure of speech in which apparently contradictory terms
appear in conjunction (e.g. *This is clearly a minor catastrophe in our coding
convention.*)
- **euphemism** – polite, indirect expression that replaces words and phrases
considered impolite (e.g. *The software is not responsive; it's just taking
a break.*)

## Paragraph structure

A well-structured paragraph presents one main idea, supported by sentences that
enhance understanding and engagement:

1) **topic sentence** – presents the main idea of the paragraph;
this sentence sets the direction and tone

2) **supporting sentences** – several sentences that elaborate on the main idea,
providing details, explanations, examples, or evidence

3) **analysis or evaluation** – connects the details to the main idea,
explaining their relevance or implications

4) **concluding sentence** – summarizes the main idea and provides a transition
to the next paragraph, if necessary
