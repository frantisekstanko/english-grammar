# English grammar

I am composing this document to improve my understanding of the English
language.
Should others find this resource useful, I would be honored.

## Nouns

Nouns are words used to identify people, places, things, or ideas.
They serve as the subjects or objects within sentences,
encapsulating everything from concrete entities to abstract concepts.

- **common nouns** – general names for people, places or things (e.g. *man*,
*city*, *function*, *database*)
- **proper nouns** – specific names of people, places or things, pointing
to unique entities (e.g. *Joseph*, *New York*, *Eiffel Tower*, *Linux*)
- **countable nouns** – nouns that allow for quantification (e.g.
*one variable*, *two variables*)
- **uncountable nouns** – nouns that do not (typically) have a plural form
(e.g. *software*, *information*, *water*); a unit of measurement can be added
to quantify these nouns (e.g. *a piece of information*, *a bottle of water*)
- **abstract nouns** – nouns representing ideas, qualities or conditions
that cannot be perceived by the human senses (e.g. *freedom*, *justice*,
*complexity*, *efficiency*)
- **concrete nouns** – opposite of abstract nouns; pointing to things that
you can either see, hear, touch, smell or taste (e.g. *monitor*)
- **collective nouns** – nouns referring to a group of individuals or things
(e.g. *family*, *team*, *array*)
- **compound nouns** – nouns made up of two or more words that together
express a single concept (e.g. *source code*, *command line*)
- **possessive nouns** – nouns indicating ownership or possession (e.g.
*application's performance*, *system's architecture*)

## Pronouns

Pronouns are words used to replace nouns, thereby avoiding repetition.

- **personal pronouns** – pronouns representing specific people or things (e.g. *he*,
*she*, *it*)
- **possessive pronouns** – pronouns indicating possession (e.g. *his*, *hers*)
- **reflexive pronouns** – pronouns used when the subject and the object of the sentence
are the same entity, indicating that an action is performed on oneself
(e.g. *myself*, *himself*, *herself*)
- **indefinite pronouns** – pronouns refering to non-specific persons or things, used
when the exact identity is unknown or irrelevant (e.g. *someone*)

## Verbs

Verbs are words that express actions, occurrences, or states of being.
They provide crucial information about what the subject is doing
or the situation the subject is in.

- **action verbs** – verbs expressing visible (physical) or conceputal (mental)
actions (e.g. *write*, *walk*, *estimate*)
- **linking verbs** – verbs connecting the subject of the sentence to a subject
complement (noun or adjective), which describes the subject (e.g. the
software *seems* faulty)
- **auxiliary verbs** – verbs used in connection with a main verb to create
phrases that convey tense, mood or voice (e.g. *be*, *have*, *do*)
- **modal verbs** – verbs conveying attitudes about the action indicated
by the main verb; a necessity, possibility, permission or ability (e.g. *can*,
*must*, *should*)
- **transitive verbs** – action verbs that require a direct object to complete
their meaning; the action of the verb is transferred to the object (e.g.
*update*, *remove*)
- **intransitive verbs** – action verbs that do not require a direct object
to complete their meaning; the action remains with the subject (e.g. *agree*,
*skip*)
- [**phrasal verbs**](verbs/phrasal-verbs.md) – phrasal verbs are combinations
of verbs with one or more particles, typically prepositions or adverbs,
which take on unique meanings distinct from the original verb (e.g. *to put
up with*)

## Adjectives

Adjectives are words that modify or describe attributes of nouns, providing
additional information about their quantity, quality, size, condition,
or origin.

- **descriptive adjectives** – describe the qualities or states
of nouns (e.g. *efficient*, *user-friendly*)
- **comparative adjectives** – compare two entities (e.g. *faster*,
*more efficient*)
- **superlative adjectives** – indicate the highest level of a particular
quality within a group of entities (e.g. *fastest algorithm*,
*least secure protocol*)
- **quantitative adjectives** – indicate the amount of nouns (e.g. *zero*,
*one*, *multiple*, *much*)
- **demonstrative adjectives** – specify which nouns we're talking about,
differentiating between things that are near or further away (e.g. *this*,
*those*, *that*)
- **possessive adjectives** – denote ownership (e.g. *my*, *your*, *their*)
- **interrogative adjectives** – modify nouns in questions (e.g. *which*,
*what*, *whose*)
- **distributive adjectives** – refer to members of a group separately (e.g.
*each*, *every*, *either*)
- **indefinite adjectives** – give general, non-specific information about
the noun (e.g. *some*, *any*, *few*)
- **ordinal adjectives** – express the position of a noun in a sequence
(e.g. *first*, *second*, *third*)
- **proper adjectives** – derived from proper nouns, these adjectives describe
a particular thing associated with a specific person or a place and are
therefore always capitalized (e.g. *Agile methodology*, *Linux-based system*)

## Prepositions

Prepositions are words that link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other parts
of a sentence, typically indicating relationships in terms of place, time,
or direction.

- **prepositions of direction** – indicate movement from one place to another
(e.g. *across*, *along*, *behind*)
- **prepositions of location** – indicate the place where something is located
(e.g. *on*, *in*, *below*)
- **prepositions of time** – denote the time something happens (e.g. *in*, *at*,
*on*)
- **prepositions of agent** – reveal the *doer* of an action in passive
sentences (e.g. *by*, *about*, *for*)
- **prepositions of manner** – indicate *how* a certain action was performed
(e.g. *via* the command line)
- **prepositions of instrument** – indicate the *tool* used to perform an action
(e.g. *with* scissors)
- **prepositions of purpose** – indicate the purpose of an action (e.g.
*through*, *beyond*)
- **prepositions of possession** – indicate ownership (*of*, *with* and *to*)

## Tenses

Tenses are used to express time in relation to the moment of speaking.

- **past simple** – describes actions completed at a specific time before
the present (e.g. *Yesterday, I debugged the application.*)
- **past continuous** – indicates an ongoing action in the past, often
occurring simultaneously with another event (e.g. *I was compiling when the
system crashed.*)
- **past perfect** – describes an action that was completed *before* another
past action (e.g. *By the time the meeting started, I had pushed my commits.*)
- **past perfect continuous** – indicates actions that were ongoing over
a period in the past and completed by a certain point in the past (e.g.
*I had been testing the application for hours before I identified the bug.*)
- **present simple** – expresses general truths or habits (e.g. *I write code
every day.*)
- **present continuous** – indicates ongoing actions occurring at the moment
of speaking (e.g. *I am performing a code review.*)
- **present perfect** – describes actions that occurred at an unspecified
time in the past and have relevance to the present moment (e.g. *I have fixed
the bug.*)
- **present perfect continuous** – indicates actions that began in the past
and continue to the present (e.g. *I have been working on this branch since
last week.*)
- **future simple** – expresses actions that will happen in the future (e.g.
*I will push my commits tomorrow.*)
- **future continuous** – indicates actions that will be ongoing at a specific
time in the future (e.g. *At this time tomorrow, I will be helping my
colleague.*)
- **future perfect** – describes actions that will be completed *before*
a certain point in the future (e.g. *By the end of the month, I will have
completed my task.*)
- **future perfect continuous** – indicates actions that will be ongoing until
a specific point in the future (e.g. *By next year, I will have been working
in this company for 5 years.*)

## Conditionals

Conditionals refer to if–then constructions that express hypotheses and their
potential consequences.

- **zero conditional** – used for facts or general truths, where the outcome
is always true if the condition is met; the structure is:  
[if] + [present simple], [present simple] (e.g. *If water reaches 100 degrees
Celsius, it boils.*)

- **first conditional** – expresses a *possible* condition and its *probable*
result in the future; the structure is:  
[if] + [present simple], [will] + [base form of the verb] (e.g. *If the user
enters incorrect login details, the system will display an error message.*)

- **second conditional** – expresses situations that are hypothetical, imaginary
or otherwise unlikely; the structure is:  
[if] + [past simple], [would] + [base form of the verb] (e.g. *If I were a
better software engineer, I would design a more efficient system.*)

- **third conditional** – reflects on the past, imagining a different outcome
from what actually happened, contradicting the past facts; the structure is:  
[if] + [past perfect], [would have] + [past participle] (e.g. *If the programmer
had written stronger tests, they would have caught the bug earlier.*)

- **mixed conditional** – combines the second and third conditionals, reflecting
a present result of an unreal past condition; the structure is:
[if] + [past perfect], [would] + [base form of verb] (e.g. *If the development
team had followed the project timeline, we would be ahead of schedule now.*)

## Articles

Articles are words that define a noun as specific or unspecific.

- **definite article** – *the* – used to refer to specific or particular nouns,
employed when both the speaker and the listener know the specific entity being
referred to, either because there is only one, or because it has been previously
mentioned or is common knowledge. (e.g. *The compiler generated an error.*)
- **indefinite article** – *a* or *an* – used to refer to non-specific nouns
that are being mentioned for the first time, or whose exact identity is not
important, or unknown (e.g. *We need a software developer for this task.*)
- **zero article** – used with plural or uncountable nouns when referring
to them in a general sense (e.g. *Software engineers are in high demand
nowadays.*)

## Adverbs

Adverbs are primarily used to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
They provide additional information about how, when, where, and to what extent
an action is performed.

- **adverbs of manner** – describe the way in which something is done (e.g.
*quickly*)
- **adverbs of frequency** – express how often an action occurs (e.g.
*frequently*)
- **adverbs of time** – describe the timing of an action (e.g. *nightly*,
*weekly*)
- **adverbs of place** – describe the location of an action (e.g. *remotely*)
- **adverbs of degree** – describe the degree of an action, adjective, or
another adverb (e.g. *nearly*)
- **adverbs of probability** – indicate the likelihood of an action happening
(e.g. *possibly*)
- **adverbs of affirmation and negation** – confirm or deny the action of the
verb (e.g. *certainly*)

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses.

- **coordinating conjunctions** – link similar elements (e.g. *The code compiles, but
does not execute.*)
- **subordinating conjunctions** – connect an independent clause with a dependent clause
(e.g. *Although the code application runs quickly, it consumes much memory.*)
- **correlative conjunctions** – link equal elements (e.g. *Either the test suite
passes, or the issue goes back to progress.*)
- **conjunctive adverbs** – link independent clauses to show cause and effect
(e.g. *therefore*, *likewise*, *otherwise*, *furthermore*)

## Clauses

Clauses typically contain a subject and a predicate, the former being the
actor in the sentence and the latter describing the action or state of being. 

- **main (independent) clauses** – are capable of standing alone as complete
sentences because they express a complete thought (e.g. *The program compiles
successfully.*)
- **subordinate (dependent) clauses** – depend on each other, as both provide
information needed to form a complete sentence (e.g. *Although we are doing
our best, we are behind schedule.*)
- [**relative (adjective) clauses**](clauses/relative-clauses.md) – provide
additional information about a noun or pronoun in the sentence (e.g. *This
feature, which was developed by John, has received good feedback.*)
- **noun clauses** – act as the subject, object, or complement in a sentence,
performing the function of a noun (e.g. *What she said at the meeting was
surprising.*)

## Types of sentences

- **simple sentence** – one independent clause without any subordinate
clauses; has a subject, a predicate, and expresses a complete thought (e.g.
*The function works correctly.*)
- **compound sentence** – two independent clauses with related ideas of equal
importance (e.g. *The developer writes the code, and the machine executes it.*)
- **complex sentence** – one independent clause and at least one dependent
clause (e.g. *If the user inputs invalid data, the program displays an error
message.*)
- **compound-complex sentence** – at least two independent clauses and at least
one dependent clause (e.g. *The software passes all tests, but when it
encounters unexpected inputs, it fails to function properly.*)
