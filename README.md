# English grammar

I am composing this document to improve my understanding of the English
language.
Should others find this resource useful, I would be honored.

## Nouns

Nouns are words used to identify people, places, things, or ideas.
They serve as the subjects or objects within sentences,
encapsulating everything from concrete entities to abstract concepts.

- **common nouns** – general names for persons, places or things (e.g. *man*,
*city*, *function*, *database*)
- **proper nouns** – specific names of people, places or things, pointing
to unique entities (e.g. *Joseph*, *New York*, *Eiffel Tower*, *Linux*)
- **countable nouns** – nouns that allow for quantification (e.g.
*one variable*, *two variables*)
- **uncountable nouns** – nouns that do not (typically) have a plural form
(e.g. *software*, *information*, *water*); a unit of measurement can be added
to quantify these nouns (e.g. *a piece of information*, *a bottle of water*)
- **abstract nouns** – nouns representing ideas, qualities or conditions
that cannot be perceived by the human senses (e.g. *freedom*, *justice*,
*complexity*, *efficiency*)
- **concrete nouns** – opposite of abstract nouns; pointing to things that
you can either see, hear, touch, smell or taste (e.g. *monitor*)
- **collective nouns** – nouns referring to a group of individuals or things
(e.g. *family*, *team*, *array*)
- **compound nouns** – nouns made up of two or more words that together
express a single concept (e.g. *source code*, *command line*)
- **possessive nouns** – nouns indicating ownership or possession (e.g.
*application's performance*, *system's architecture*)

## Pronouns

Pronouns are words used to replace nouns, thereby avoiding repetition.

- **personal pronouns** – pronouns representing specific people or things (e.g. *he*,
*she*, *it*)
- **possessive pronouns** – pronouns indicating possession (e.g. *his*, *hers*)
- **reflexive pronouns** – pronouns used when the subject and the object of the sentence
are the same entity, indicating that an action is performed on oneself
(e.g. *myself*, *himself*, *herself*)
- **indefinite pronouns** – pronouns refering to non-specific persons or things, used
when the exact identity is unknown or irrelevant (e.g. *someone*)

## Verbs

Verbs are words that express actions, occurrences, or states of being.
They provide crucial information about what the subject is doing
or the situation the subject is in.

- **action verbs** – verbs expressing visible (physical) or conceputal (mental)
actions (e.g. *write*, *walk*, *estimate*)
- **linking verbs** – verbs connecting the subject of the sentence to a subject
complement (noun or adjective), which describes the subject (e.g. the
software *seems* faulty)
- **auxiliary verbs** – verbs used in connection with a main verb to create
phrases that convey tense, mood or voice (e.g. *be*, *have*, *do*)
- **modal verbs** – verbs conveying attitudes about the action indicated
by the main verb; a necessity, possibility, permission or ability (e.g. *can*,
*must*, *should*)
- **transitive verbs** – action verbs that require a direct object to complete
their meaning; the action of the verb is transferred to the object (e.g.
*update*, *remove*)
- **intransitive verbs** – action verbs that do not require a direct object
to complete their meaning; the action remains with the subject (e.g. *agree*,
*skip*)

## Adjectives

Adjectives are words that modify or describe attributes of nouns, providing
additional information about their quantity, quality, size, condition,
or origin.

- **descriptive adjectives** – describe the qualities or states
of nouns (e.g. *efficient*, *user-friendly*)
- **comparative adjectives** – compare two entities (e.g. *faster*,
*more efficient*)
- **superlative adjectives** – indicate the highest level of a particular
quality within a group of entities (e.g. *fastest algorithm*,
*least secure protocol*)
- **quantitative adjectives** – indicate the amount of nouns (e.g. *zero*,
*one*, *multiple*, *much*)
- **demonstrative adjectives** – specify which nouns we're talking about,
differentiating between things that are near or further away (e.g. *this*,
*those*, *that*)
- **possessive adjectives** – denote ownership (e.g. *my*, *your*, *their*)
- **interrogative adjectives** – modify nouns in questions (e.g. *which*,
*what*, *whose*)
- **distributive adjectives** – refer to members of a group separately (e.g.
*each*, *every*, *either*)
- **indefinite adjectives** – give general, non-specific information about
the noun (e.g. *some*, *any*, *few*)
- **ordinal adjectives** – express the position of a noun in a sequence
(e.g. *first*, *second*, *third*)
- **proper adjectives** – derived from proper nouns, these adjectives describe
a particular thing associated with a specific person or a place and are
therefore always capitalized (e.g. *Agile methodology*, *Linux-based system*)

## Prepositions

Prepositions are words that link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other parts
of a sentence, typically indicating relationships in terms of place, time,
or direction.

- **prepositions of direction** – indicate movement from one place to another
(e.g. *across*, *along*, *behind*)
- **prepositions of location** – indicate the place where something is located
(e.g. *on*, *in*, *below*)
- **prepositions of time** – denote the time something happens (e.g. *in*, *at*,
*on*)
- **prepositions of agent** – reveal the *doer* of an action in passive
sentences (e.g. *by*, *about*, *for*)
- **prepositions of manner** – indicate *how* a certain action was performed
(e.g. *via* the command line)
- **prepositions of instrument** – indicate the *tool* used to perform an action
(e.g. *with* scissors)
- **prepositions of purpose** – indicate the purpose of an action (e.g.
*through*, *beyond*)
- **prepositions of possession** – indicate ownership (*of*, *with* and *to*)

## Tenses

Tenses are used to express time in relation to the moment of speaking.

- **past simple** – describes actions completed at a specific time before
the present (e.g. *Yesterday, I debugged the application.*)
- **past continuous** – indicates an ongoing action in the past, often
occurring simultaneously with another event (e.g. *I was compiling when the
system crashed.*)
- **past perfect** – describes an action that was completed *before* another
past action (e.g. *By the time the meeting started, I had pushed my commits.*)
- **past perfect continuous** – indicates actions that were ongoing over
a period in the past and completed by a certain point in the past (e.g.
*I had been testing the application for hours before I identified the bug.*)
- **present simple** – expresses general truths or habits (e.g. *I write code
every day.*)
- **present continuous** – indicates ongoing actions occurring at the moment
of speaking (e.g. *I am performing a code review.*)
- **present perfect** – describes an actions that occurred at an unspecified
time in the past and have relevance to the present moment (e.g. *I have fixed
the bug.*)
- **present perfect continuous** – indicates actions that began in the past
and continue to the present (e.g. *I have been working on this branch since
last week.*)
- **future simple** – expresses actions that will happen in the future (e.g.
*I will push my commits tomorrow.*)
- **future continuous** – indicates actions that will be ongoing at a specific
time in the future (e.g. *At this time tomorrow, I will be helping my
colleague.*)
- **future perfect** – describes actions that will be completed *before*
a certain point in the future (e.g. *By the end of the month, I will have
completed my task.*)
- **future perfect continuous** – indicates actions that will be ongoing until
a specific point in the future (e.g. *By next year, I will have been working
in this company for 5 years.*)

## Conditionals

Conditionals refer to if–then constructions that express hypotheses and their
potential consequences.

- **zero conditional** – used for facts or general truths, where the outcome
is always true if the condition is met; the structure is:  
[if] + [present simple], [present simple] (e.g. *If water reaches 100 degrees
Celsius, it boils.*)

- **first conditional** – expresses a *possible* condition and its *probable*
result in the future; the structure is:  
[if] + [present simple], [will] + [base form of the verb] (e.g. *If the user
enters incorrect login details, the system will display an error message.*)

- **second conditional** – expresses situations that are hypothetical, imaginary
or otherwise unlikely; the structure is:  
[if] + [past simple], [would] + [base form of the verb] (e.g. *If I were a
better software engineer, I would design a more efficient system.*)

- **third conditional** – reflects on the past, imagining a different outcome
from what actually happened, contradicting the past facts; the structure is:  
[if] + [past perfect], [would have] + [past participle] (e.g. *If the programmer
had written stronger tests, they would have caught the bug earlier.*)

- **mixed conditional** – combines the second and third conditionals, reflecting
a present result of an unreal past condition; the structure is:
[if] + [past perfect], [would] + [base form of verb] (e.g. *If the development
team had followed the project timeline, we would be ahead of schedule now.*)

## Phrasal verbs

Phrasal verbs are combinations of verbs with one or more particles,
typically prepositions or adverbs, which take on unique meanings distinct from
the original verb.

- **intransitive phrasal verbs** – do not require an object to complete their
meaning (e.g. *shut down*)
- **separable transitive phrasal verbs** – require an object, by which they
can be separated (e.g. *back up the data*, *back the data up*)
- **inseparable transitive phrasal verbs** – require an object, which cannot
separate the verb and particle (e.g. *look into a bug*, never ~~*look a
bug into*~~)
- **three-part phrasal verbs** – verbs followed by two particles (e.g. *to
fill out a form*, *to look forward to*, *to put up with*)

## Relative clauses

Relative clauses are types of subordinate clauses used to provide additional
information about a noun in the main clause.

- **defining relative clauses** – clauses which are essential to the meaning
of the sentence; without them, the sentence's meaning would be incomplete; they
are not set off by commas (e.g. *We must improve the function that encrypts
the data.*)
- **non-defining relative clauses** – clauses which add extra, non-essential
information, which is not needed to complete the meaning of the main sentence
(e.g. *This feature, which was developed by John, has received good feedback.*)
