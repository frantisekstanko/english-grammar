# English grammar

I am composing this document to improve my understanding of the English
language.
Should others find this resource useful, I would be honored.

## Nouns

Nouns are words used to identify people, places, things, or ideas.
They serve as the subjects or objects within sentences,
encapsulating everything from concrete entities to abstract concepts.

- **common nouns** – general names for persons, places or things (e.g. *man*,
*city*, *function*, *database*)
- **proper nouns** – specific names of people, places or things, pointing
to unique entities (e.g. *Joseph*, *New York*, *Eiffel Tower*, *Linux*)
- **countable nouns** – nouns that allow for quantification (e.g.
*one variable*, *two variables*)
- **uncountable nouns** – nouns that do not (typically) have a plural form
(e.g. *software*, *information*, *water*); a unit of measurement can be added
to quantify these nouns (e.g. *a piece of information*, *a bottle of water*)
- **abstract nouns** – nouns representing ideas, qualities or conditions
that cannot be perceived by the human senses (e.g. *freedom*, *justice*,
*complexity*, *efficiency*)
- **concrete nouns** – opposite of abstract nouns; pointing to things that
you can either see, hear, touch, smell or taste (e.g. *monitor*)
- **collective nouns** – nouns referring to a group of individuals or things
(e.g. *family*, *team*, *array*)
- **compound nouns** – nouns made up of two or more words that together
express a single concept (e.g. *source code*, *command line*)
- **possessive nouns** – nouns indicating ownership or possession (e.g.
*application's performance*, *system's architecture*)

## Pronouns

Pronouns are words used to replace nouns, thereby avoiding repetition.

- **personal pronouns** – pronouns representing specific people or things (e.g. *he*,
*she*, *it*)
- **possessive pronouns** – pronouns indicating possession (e.g. *his*, *hers*)
- **reflexive pronouns** – pronouns used when the subject and the object of the sentence
are the same entity, indicating that an action is performed on oneself
(e.g. *myself*, *himself*, *herself*)
- **indefinite pronouns** – pronouns refering to non-specific persons or things, used
when the exact identity is unknown or irrelevant (e.g. *someone*)

## Verbs

Verbs are words that express actions, occurrences, or states of being.
They provide crucial information about what the subject is doing
or the situation the subject is in.

- **action verbs** – verbs expressing visible (physical) or conceputal (mental)
actions (e.g. *write*, *walk*, *estimate*)
- **linking verbs** – verbs connecting the subject of the sentence to a subject
complement (noun or adjective), which describes the subject (e.g. the
software *seems* faulty)
- **auxiliary verbs** – verbs used in connection with a main verb to create
phrases that convey tense, mood or voice (e.g. *be*, *have*, *do*)
- **modal verbs** – verbs conveying attitudes about the action indicated
by the main verb; a necessity, possibility, permission or ability (e.g. *can*,
*must*, *should*)
- **transitive verbs** – action verbs that require a direct object to complete
their meaning; the action of the verb is transferred to the object (e.g.
*update*, *remove*)
- **intransitive verbs** – action verbs that do not require a direct object
to complete their meaning; the action remains with the subject (e.g. *agree*,
*skip*)
