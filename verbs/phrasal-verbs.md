# Phrasal verbs

Phrasal verbs are combinations of verbs with one or more particles,
typically prepositions or adverbs, which take on unique meanings distinct from
the original verb.

- **intransitive phrasal verbs** – do not require an object to complete their
meaning (e.g. *shut down*)
- **separable transitive phrasal verbs** – require an object, by which they
can be separated (e.g. *back up the data*, *back the data up*)
- **inseparable transitive phrasal verbs** – require an object, which cannot
separate the verb and particle (e.g. *look into a bug*, never ~~*look a
bug into*~~)
- **three-part phrasal verbs** – verbs followed by two particles (e.g. *to
fill out a form*, *to look forward to*, *to put up with*)
