# Relative clauses

Relative clauses are types of subordinate clauses used to provide additional
information about a noun in the main clause.

- **defining relative clauses** – clauses which are essential to the meaning
of the sentence; without them, the sentence's meaning would be incomplete; they
are not set off by commas (e.g. *We must improve the function that encrypts
the data.*)
- **non-defining relative clauses** – clauses which add extra, non-essential
information, which is not needed to complete the meaning of the main sentence
(e.g. *This feature, which was developed by John, has received good feedback.*)
- **reduced relative clauses** – defining or non-defining relative clauses
where the relative pronoun and the auxiliary verb are omitted
(e.g. *The algorithm running the process is highly efficient.*)
- **contact clauses** – defining relative clauses where the relative pronoun
is omitted (e.g. *The software engineer we hired last month has already made
significant contributions.*)
- **relative clauses with prepositions** – clauses where the preposition is
placed at the beginning of the relative clause (e.g. *The database to which
the application connects is highly secure.*)
